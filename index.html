        <p id="second">That <i>story</i> not only has <b>Action</b>, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch 
            and their kids and the skills of the makers and the thoughts of the 
            thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all 
            been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn't their 
            story. It's his.</p>

        <p>Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of 
            container in general, a thing that holds something else.</p>
        <h4>3</h4>
        <p>If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because 
            it's useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of 
            rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have 
            you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger 
            kind of pouch or bag, a container for people , and then later on you 
            take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider 
            container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the 
            museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and 
            then next day you probably do much the same again-if to do that is 
            human, if that's what it takes, then I am a human being after all. 
            Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.</p>
